## Funding Request: [insert your name], [insert funding period]

<!-- This funding request template was made based on past experiences and debates on the Grin Forum about the necessity to have clear, 
transparent and unambiguous information in funding requests. 
This template is not intended to be exhaustive and only serves as a guideline to clearly communicate the minimal amount of information 
needed for the GRIN community to assess requests for funding. Feel free to add and modify to this template to improve clarity and transparency. 
However, let us aim to keep this funding template minimal and elegant like GRIN and the Mimble Wimble protocol itself. 
For ease of comparison of funding requests, it is advised to provide these fields of information in the order given below. -->
