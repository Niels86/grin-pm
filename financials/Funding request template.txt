## Template for funding request
This funding request template was made based on past experiences and debates on the Grin Forum about the necessity to have clear, 
transparent and unambiguous information in funding requests. 
This template is not intended to be exhaustive and only serves as a guideline to clearly communicate the minimal amount of information 
needed for the GRIN community to assess requests for funding. Feel free to add and modify to this template to improve clarity and transparency. 
However, let us aim to keep this funding template minimal and elegant like GRIN and the Mimble Wimble protocol itself. 
For ease of comparison of funding requests, it is advised to provide these fields of information in the order given below.

## Financial information
•	Funding period: 
o	(e.g. 3 months)
•	Total amount of requested funding:
o	State total amount of requested funding in this period as well as in the preceding funding period both in USD and local currency
•	Requested funding per month and number FTE’s
o	E.g. 1 FTE is equivalent to 40 hours per week
o	Provide requested funding per month in USDs (based on 3 months average in Google) as well as in home currency
o	Provide the % increase/decrease in hour rate compared to previous period based on the USD value. If increased, provide an explanation why the increase is requested, e.g. I do not ask for a raise since the value requested in my home currency is the same.
•	Country from which you work:
o	In case of residency in multiple countries, provide additional information (e.g. 0.5 FTE in Philippines, 0.5 FTE in US)
o	If changed from previous period, provide explanation why the increase in hours is needed
